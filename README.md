HyperExecute is a smart test orchestration platform to run end-to-end Selenium tests at the fastest speed possible. HyperExecute lets you achieve an accelerated time to market by providing a test infrastructure that offers optimal speed, test orchestration, and detailed execution logs.

The overall experience helps teams test code and fix issues at a much faster pace. HyperExecute is configured using a YAML file. Instead of moving the Hub close to you, HyperExecute brings the test scripts close to the Hub!

# Pre-requisites

Before using HyperExecute, you have to download HyperExecute CLI corresponding to the host OS. Along with it, you also need to export the environment variables *LT_USERNAME* and *LT_ACCESS_KEY* that are available in the [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile) page.

## Download HyperExecute CLI

HyperExecute CLI is the CLI for interacting and running the tests on the HyperExecute Grid. The CLI provides a host of other useful features that accelerate test execution. In order to trigger tests using the CLI, you need to download the HyperExecute CLI binary corresponding to the platform (or OS) from where the tests are triggered:

Also, it is recommended to download the binary in the project's parent directory. Shown below is the location from where you can download the HyperExecute CLI binary:

* Mac: https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/darwin/hyperexecute
* Linux: https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/linux/hyperexecute
* Windows: https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/windows/hyperexecute.exe

## Configure Environment Variables

Before the tests are run, please set the environment variables <b>LT_USERNAME</b> & <b>LT_ACCESS_KEY</b> from the terminal. The account details are available on your [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile) page.

For macOS:

```bash
export LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

For Linux:

```bash
export LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

For Windows:

```bash
set LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
set LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

The <b>HYPERXECUTE_PLATFORM</b> environment variable must be set to the platform (or operating system) on which you wish to perform the test execution. Here are the values that can be assigned to HYPEREXECUTE_PLATFORM

* win10 for Windows OS
* linux for Linux OS
* macOS Catalina for macOS

Use the commands mentioned below, to set the HyperExecute Platform (i.e. HYPEREXECUTE_PLATFORM) to Linux, macOS, or Windows respectively:

Host OS: Linux

```bash
export HYPERXECUTE_PLATFORM=win10
export HYPERXECUTE_PLATFORM=linux
export HYPERXECUTE_PLATFORM=macOS Catalina
```

Host OS: macOS

```bash
export HYPERXECUTE_PLATFORM=win10
export HYPERXECUTE_PLATFORM=linux
export HYPERXECUTE_PLATFORM=macOS Catalina
```

Host OS: Windows

```bash
set HYPERXECUTE_PLATFORM=wind10
set HYPERXECUTE_PLATFORM=linux
set HYPERXECUTE_PLATFORM=macOS Catalina
```
